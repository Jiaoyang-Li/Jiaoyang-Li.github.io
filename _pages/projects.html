My research focuses on developing fundamental algorithms that enable large teams of autonomous agents
to accomplish collaborative tasks intelligently in dynamic environments.
Applications of my research include
mobile robot coordination for automated warehousing and, in general, nonholonomic robot teams,
drone swarm control,
multi-arm assembly,
character control in video games,
and traffic management for airports, railway networks, and road intersections with autonomous cars.
