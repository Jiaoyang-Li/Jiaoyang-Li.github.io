Course Introduction
======
### Overview:
This course provides an overview of the current techniques that allow robots to move around, interact with the world, and keep track of where they are. 
The kinematics and dynamics of electromechanical systems will be covered with a particular focus on their application to robotic arms. 
Some basic principles of robot control will be discussed, ranging from independent-joint PID tracking to coupled computed torque approaches. 
State estimation techniques including the Kalman filter will be covered, especially as they are used in solving common problems faced in robotics applications.


### Textbook: 
There is no assigned textbook for this class. 
However, there are some books that you might find useful as reference material for various parts of the class:

### Prerequisite knowledge: 
There are no formal prerequisites for this class. 
Informally, a year of calculus, a year of programming, and familiarity with matrix algebra will greatly increase your chances of success in this class. 
Also helpful, but not required, is a course on classical mechanics.
