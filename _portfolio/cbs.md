excerpt: "

Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a challenging combinatorial problem that asks us to plan collision-free paths for team of cooperative agents. One of the reasons MAPF problems are so hard to solve is due to a phenomena called pairwise path symmetry, which occurs when two agents have many equivalent paths, all of which appear promising, but which are
pairwise incompatible because they result in a collision. 
The symmetry arises commonly in practice and can produce an exponential explosion in the space of possible collision resolutions, leading to unacceptable runtimes for currently state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms that employ heuristic search, such as Conflict-based Search (CBS).
To break symmetries, we propose a variety of constraint-based reasoning techniques, to detect the symmetries as they arise and to efficiently eliminate, in a single branching step, all permutations of two currently assigned but pairwise incompatible paths."

## Symmetry Reasoning for Multi-Agent Path Finding

We describe a new way of reasoning about symmetric collisions for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) on 4-neighbor grids. We also introduce a symmetry-breaking constraint to resolve these conflicts. This specialized technique allows us to identify and eliminate, in a single step, all permutations of two currently assigned but incompatible paths. Each such permutation has exactly the same cost as a current path, and each one results in a new collision between the same two agents. We show that the addition of symmetry-breaking techniques can lead to an exponential reduction in the size of the search space of CBS, a popular framework for MAPF, and report significant improvements in both runtime and success rate versus CBSH and EPEA* â€“ two recent and state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms.
