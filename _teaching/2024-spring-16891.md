Course Introduction
======
### Overview:
The course provides a graduate-level introduction to the field of multi-robot planning and coordination from both AI and robotics perspectives. 
Topics for the course include multi-robot cooperative task planning, multi-robot path/motion planning, learning for coordination, coordinating robots under uncertainty, etc. 
The course will particularly focus on state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Path Finding algorithms that can coordinate hundreds of robots with rigorous theoretical guarantees. 
Current applications for these technologies will be highlighted, such as mobile robot coordination for warehouses and drone swarm control. 

### Textbook: 
There is no assigned textbook for this class. Reference materials are provided in the course schedule as well as the lecture slides.

### Course Description: 
The course includes lectures, research paper presentations and discussions, and course projects. 
The majority of this course is a seminar-style survey of issues and approaches to planning and coordination in multi-robot systems. 
Although the subject area is multi-robot coordination, it is also an explicit goal of this course to advance students' critical thinking and communication skills, which is achieved through discussions, presentations, and report writing. 

### Prerequisite knowledge: 
There are no formal prerequisites for this class.  
Informally, students should be familiar with algorithms and informed search (for example, A*). 
Students should also have basic knowledge of probability and physics (kinematics).

### Course topics: 
Each of the following 7 topics will be covered by 2-6 lectures:
- Basics of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)
- Combined (Multi-Robot) Task and Path Planning
- (Multi-Robot) Planning and Coordination under Uncertainty
- Decentralized (Multi-Robot) Planning and Coordination
- (Multi-Robot) Planning with Robot Dynamics
- Learning for (Multi-Robot) Planning and Coordination
- (Multi-Robot) Applications
