Multi-robot assembly systems are becoming increasingly appealing in manufacturing 
due to their ability to automatically, flexibly, and quickly construct desired structural designs. 
However, effectively planning for these systems in a manner 
that ensures each robot is simultaneously productive, and not idle, is challenging due to 
(1) the close proximity that the robots must operate in to manipulate the structure, 
(2) the inherent structural partial orderings on when each part can be installed, and
(3) the various types of tasks that need be done cooperatively among multiple robots.
