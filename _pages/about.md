I am a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Southern California. My advisor is Professor [Sven Koenig](http://idm-lab.org/index.html) .

I received my B.Eng degree from Department of Automation, School of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University.

I am interested in a variety of topics related to Artificial Intelligence, such as combinatorial algorithms, heuristic search, scheduling and planning for robotics and transportation. 

You can find my CV [here](http://jiaoyang-li.github.io/files/CV-Jiaoyang.pdf).
